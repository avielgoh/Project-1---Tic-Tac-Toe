## Tic Tac Toe
___________________________________________________________________________________

#### Overview

Tic tac toe (also known as noughts and crosses) is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 Ã— 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

#### Objective

Build a web application that allows two players to play tic tac toe.

*This project was undertaken as part of the General Assembly WDI course I undertook in 2015.*

#### Technologies

1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. jQuery
5. Underscore.js
6. Font Awesome

#### Approach

In developing this web application, the biggest problem that needed to be solved was verifying whether a winning combination existed after each player input. The reason for this is that a player can win by having three marks in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row (as displayed below). As such, there are 8 possible configurations that would allow a player to win and therefore 8 configurations that needed to be checked.

                             [7]  [8]  [9] - rowC
                              |    |    |
                             colA colB colC

###### The way that I approached and solved this problem is as follows:

1. Define 3 arrays for each row (i.e. `rowA`, `rowB` and `rowC`) that contained 3 empty strings each

2. Replace an empty string with the input from a players' click, using the `.splice` array method, in the relevant row-array based on the index of the button pressed

3. Define and call a function called `column()` to create 3 arrays for each column (i.e. `colA`, `colB` and `colC`) based on the elements and their respective positions in the row-arrays

4. Define and call another function called `diagonal()` to create 2 arrays for each diagonal (i.e. `diagL` and `diagR`), also based on the elements and their respective positions in the row-arrays

5. Using the `_.each` function from the *Underscore.js* JavaScript library to loop through each of the 8 arrays, I was able to then use the `_.difference` function also from the *Underscore.js* JavaScript library to compare the arrays to a pre-determined winning array `var boardXWin = ["X", "X", "X"];` and `var boardOWin = ["O", "O", "O"];` and determine whether a win had occurred in any of the 8 configurations.

  ```javascript
    _.each(boardKeys, function(key, index) { // loops through all 8 arrays
      if (_.difference(eval('board.' + key), boardXWin).length === 0) { // blank array indicates winner is 'X'
        winnerX();
        return;
      } else if (_.difference(eval('board.' + key), boardOWin).length === 0) { // blank array indicates winner is 'O'
        winnerO();
        return;
      }
    });
  ```

  As the `_.difference` function returns any elements that are different between two arrays, if the length of returned array is equal to 0, this indicates there is no difference and, therefore, a winning combination of 3 marks exists.

6. For completeness, a tie was determined by using the `.concat` array method to concatenate and create a single array from the 3 row-arrays, and checking whether an empty element exists in the single, 9 element array. As this was performed after the checks for a winning configuration, no empty elements indicated a draw.
